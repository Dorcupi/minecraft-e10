# Minecraft E10: Minecraft 10x Easier

### Part 1: I've always thought Minecraft was too easy…  

That's just been the way it always has been. As updates go on, more features get added to the game and although it may seem good, it just keeps making the game easier. That was why I made Minecraft H10, my datapack that made Minecraft "ten times harder" (it was more like 100 times), and it got popular-ish but then I realised something very important.  
  
  

### Part 2: Not everyone is good at Minecraft…  

Although speedrunners are able to beat the game in minutes, not everyone can do that. Some people take years just to find diamonds! And the more I thought of that, the more I got an idea. A datapack that will make all people afraid of going into a cave come together and beat the game for the first (or 365th) time. That is what Minecraft E10 is about.
